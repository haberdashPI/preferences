// # Advanced vim presets

// This document provides a more advanced set of vim keybindings than provided in
// the [tutorial](../tutorial.html). The goal of these bindings is to lower the barrier to
// entry for Vim users who don't want to spend the time defining bindings from
// ground up. A secondary goal is to show off some of the more advanced features of
// ModalKeys that were not discussed in the tutorial.

// If you want to modify these presets you can export and modify them using the
// "ModalKeys: Export a preset for keybindings" command. After making any
// desired changes you can import them with the "ModalKeys: Import preset
// keybindings" command.

// If you are not interested in how the Vim keybindings are implemented and just
// want to use them, you can skip this discussion. Just import the presets by
// pressing <key>Ctrl/Cmd</key>+<key>Shift</key>+<key>P</key> and running command
// `ModalKeys: Import preset keybindings`. You will be presented a choice to
// import either Vim bindings or any presets that you have created yourself. If
// you are planning to customize the bindings, or create Vim-style commands from
// scratch, this document gives you pointers on how to go about doing that.

// Unlike the tutorial, the assumption throughout this documentation is that you
// are familiar with vim. All concepts discussed here are introduced, at least
// briefly, in the tutorial.

// ## Functions

// To begin with, we'll define some functions for use in our keybindings. Since
// imported keybindings can be defined using javascript, this can help generalize
// our bindings, allowing us to create many keybindings at once. In vim, the
// cannonical use for this would be the operator/object combinations: e.g. to
// delete a word you type <key>d</key> (for delete) and <key>w</key> (for word). This noun-verb
// structure implies many possible shortcuts.

// You can see these functions in use when [we define motions](#editing-with-motions)

// ## Game Plan

// We start with basic motion commands which are mostly straightforward to
// implement. 

// A few notes:

// - Where useful, `__count` is used to provide the number argument
// (e.g. the `3` in 3l) to a given command.
// - When in visual model, most of the commands are built to extend the selection

// Editing commands in normal mode typically either affect current character or

// as well. If you are wondering why we don't use VS Code's cut command, it has a
// synchronization issue that sometimes causes the execution to advance to the

// that these do not work exactly the same as the VIM commands. In vim paste
// behaviors differently depending on whether you have a single line or multiple
// lines in the clipboard. You would need to write a VSCode extension that inspects
// the contents of the clipboard before pasting to get this same behavior.

// ## Editing with Motions

// So, far we have kept the structure of keybindings quite simple. Now we tackle
// the types of keybinding that work in tandem with motion commands. Examples of
// such commands include:

// <key>c</key><key>i</key><key>b</key> - Change text inside curly braces `{}`

// <key>></key><key>G</key> - Indent rest of the file

// <key>y</key><key>\`</key><key>a</key> - Yank text from cursor position to mark `a`

// We can combine any editing command with any motion, which gives us thousands
// of possible combinations. First type the command key and then motion which
// specifies the position or range you want to apply the command to.

// | Keys          | Command
// | ------------- | ---------------------------
// | `d`<_motion_> | Delete range specified by <_motion_>
// | `c`<_motion_> | Delete range specified by <_motion_> and switch to insert mode
// | `y`<_motion_> | Yank range specified by <_motion_> to clipboard
// | `>`<_motion_> | Indent range specified by <_motion_>
// | `<`<_motion_> | Outdent range specified by <_motion_>
// | `=`<_motion_> | Reindent (reformat) range specified by <_motion_>

// We can define all commands listed above in a single keybinding block. Remember
// that our strategy is just to map the key sequences of the edit commands that use
// motions to equivalent commands that work in visual mode. We do the specified
// motion in visual mode selecting a range of text, and then running the command
// on the selection. It does not matter which editing command we run, all of them
// can be mapped the same way.

// ## Searching

// Searching introduces a pseudo-mode that captures the keyboard and suspends other
// commands as long as search is on. Searching commands are shown below.

// | Keys      | Command
// | --------- | --------------------
// | `/`       | Start case-sensitive search forwards
// | `?`       | Start case-sensitive search backwards
// | `n`       | Select the next match
// | `p`       | Select the previous match

// **Note**: Searching commands work also with multiple cursors. As in Vim, search
// wraps around if top or bottom of file is encountered.

// ## Miscellaneous Commands

// Rest of the normal mode commands are not motion or editing commands, but do
// miscellaenous things.

// | Keys      | Command
// | --------- | ---------------------------------
// | `:`       | Show command menu (same as <key>Ctrl/Cmd</key><key>Shift</key><key>P</key>)
// | `zz`      | Center cursor on screen
// | `ZZ`      | Save file and close the current editor (tab)
// | `ZQ`      | Close the current editor without saving

// Note that <key>Z</key><key>Q</key> command still asks to save the file, if
// it has been changed. There is no way to get around this in VS Code.

// ## Conclusion

// The list of commands we provided is by no means exhaustive but still contains
// about a thousand key combinations that cover many commonly used Vim
// operations. This is quite a nice achievement considering that we only wrote
// about 400 lines of configuration, and most of it is pretty trivial. This
// demonstrates that ModalKeys's functionality is powerful enough to build all
// kinds of operations that make modal editors like Vim popular.
//
// For a full least of features available in ModalKeys, please refer to the
// [documentation](../doc_index.html)
